The key class is StockMarketServiceImpl.java.
The key test is StockMarketServiceImplTest.java.

I have not included a main routine, instead the source code works from the included test 
scripts.  Hope this is acceptable.

I have created two data objects, Trade and Stock, along with repositories for each of 
these.  There are two service objects, one which manages the Trade functions and one which
provides the functions for the Stock Market.
